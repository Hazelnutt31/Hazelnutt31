# Introduction

## Hello, my name is **Hazelnut**

I am a developer passionate about programming, currently working on several projects in C++, C#, and other technologies. My main focus is on desktop applications and automation, though I also have experience in game development using OpenGL and Godot Engine.

### Some of my current projects include:

- **Bing Search Automation with Microsoft Edge**: I'm using C# to automate search processes, optimizing the collection of reward points.
- **FPS Game Development**: I'm creating a first-person shooter game using C++ and OpenGL, with basic mechanics like shooting and navigating the environment.
- **Applications with GUI**: I design user interfaces with Windows Forms to simplify interaction in my automation projects.

### Technical Experience:

- **Programming Languages**: C++, C#, Python.
- **Development Tools**: Visual Studio, Git, WSL.
- **Other Interests**: Hardware diagnostics, and process synchronization in operating systems.

I'm always open to new opportunities and collaborations. If you have an interesting idea or want to discuss a project, feel free to reach out.
